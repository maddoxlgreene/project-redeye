# Project Redeye

**Project Redeye** is a reconnaissance and asset discovery utility designed for ethical security testing.

It helps you:
1. **Enumerate subdomains** (via Amass/Sublist3r if installed, or fallback wordlist).
2. **Scan open ports/services** (via Nmap if installed, or a lightweight socket scanner).
3. **Enrich host intelligence** (via the Shodan API).
